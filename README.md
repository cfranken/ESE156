# ESE156 Remote Sensing Class

ESE156 will cover the basics of remote sensing with a focus on atmospheric and surface remote sensing using spectroscopy. The class will guide you through typical steps of relevance to all remote sensing problem, i.e. how to set up and formulate your "Forward model", applying constrained and un-constrained, linear and non-linear inverse modeling and perform error characterization of measurements and inverted properties. The class syllabus is still not written in stone but follows these general steps:

**Week 1:** Basic introduction and simple inverse technique by linearizing Lambert-Beer’s law

**Week 2:** Computing layer optical properties using atmospheric model output as well as cross section databases (line-by-line modeling)

**Week 3:** Simplified synthetic retrievals of total columns of strong absorbers (using TCCON as analogy), generating a non-linear forward model and its derivatives

**Week 4:** Based on simple forward model developed in Week 3: Use of prior constraints, information content analysis, error analysis, impact of spectroscopic uncertainties…

**Week 5:** Impact of scattering (Rayleigh, aerosols, clouds) on observations from space

**Week 6:** Nadir sounders in the thermal infrared: Radiative transfer and retrieval principles.

**Week 7:** Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Vegetation Indices.

**Weeks 8-10:** Hands-on examples or paper.

### Getting started: 

The ESE156 Remote Sensing Class will make extensive use of the Jupyter notebook environment as well as python as a coding tool. If you aren't familiar with Python yet, there are good resources online, e.g.

Install for beginners: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/

Data Science: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/

Jupyter: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/

My goal is to have everyone set up with python and jupyter notebook in week 1. If needed, we will go through some basic python steps in the beginning as well (and/or communicate with the TA).
